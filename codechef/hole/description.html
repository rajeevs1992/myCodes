<h1>Holes</h1>
You want to know how many holes are in a text. What is a hole? If you think of the paper as 
the plane and a letter as a curve on the plane, then each letter divides the plane into regions. 
For example letters "A", "D", "O", "P", "R" divide the plane into two regions so we say 
these letters each have one hole. Similarly, letter "B" has two holes and letters such as 
"C", "E", "F", "K" have no holes. We say that the number of holes in the text is equal to 
the total number of holes in the letters of the text. Help Chef to determine how many holes are in the text.
